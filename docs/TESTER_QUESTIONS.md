# Tester questions (ask exactly these)

1) Does this map to a real failure you’ve seen? If yes, which workflow?
2) What is the single most dangerous tool in your stack if an agent misfires?
3) Where do retries / loops / stale context happen in your workflows?
4) What would you require before trusting a runtime gate like this in prod?
