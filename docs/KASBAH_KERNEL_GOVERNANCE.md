# Kasbah Kernel Governance

## WHAT IS A KERNEL CHANGE
- Decision types
- State transitions
- Risk aggregation math
- Ticket semantics
- Audit guarantees

Adapters and configs do NOT count.

---

## CHANGE PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Written proposal
2. Version bump (major)
3. Dual-run comparison
4. Logged migration event

---

## AUTHORITY
Only named Kernel Maintainers may change kernel.
All changes must be signed and auditable.

Customer requests NEVER justify kernel mutation.

Kernel integrity > features.
