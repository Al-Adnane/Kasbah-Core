# Email Templates for Feedback Phase

## Template 1: Follow-up with testers who gave feedback

Subject: Re: Kasbah feedback - I fixed it

Hey [Name],

Thanks for the honest feedback on Kasbah! You nailed the problem.

I rewrote the landing page based on your input:
https://al-adnane.github.io/Kasbah-Core/?v=120

**What changed:**
- Hero now shows concrete scenario: "Your AI refunded wrong customer"
- Added integration code examples (LangChain, OpenAI, etc)
- Demo-first layout - buttons appear immediately

Would love 2 more minutes of your time:

1. Does this version click better?
2. If you were integrating tomorrow, what's your #1 blocker?
3. Would you do a quick 15-min call to walk through your agent stack?

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. The "ralph loop" comment - were you referring to ReAct/Agent loop? Want to make sure I have that pattern covered.

## Template 2: Send to Wave 2 (next 40 testers)

Subject: Kasbah Wave 2 - feedback from first 10

Hey [Name],

I invited 10 engineers to test Kasbah last week.

Early feedback:
- "Now I get it - the refund scenario clicked" 
- "Would use this for our customer support agent"
- Fixed: confusion about what it does, added integration examples

You're in Wave 2 (40 engineers).

Try it (2 min):
https://al-adnane.github.io/Kasbah-Core/?v=120

**What to do:**
1. Click all 4 demo buttons
2. Read the "mundane failure" scenario
3. Tell me what's broken/confusing via the feedback link

If you want to integrate for real, I can help this week.

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. Built in Rabat. MIT licensed. No VC money.

## Template 3: Thank you (for people who test but don't respond)

Subject: Thanks for testing Kasbah

Hey [Name],

Saw you visited the Kasbah demo - thanks for checking it out!

Quick question: what stopped you from giving feedback?

- Too busy right now
- Didn't understand what it does
- Not relevant to my work
- Something else?

No pressure - just trying to improve it.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Template 4: Feature request response

Subject: Re: [Feature request]

Hey [Name],

Great suggestion on [feature].

Quick question before I build it:
- How would you use this in your current agent stack?
- Is this a "nice to have" or "must have" for you to adopt Kasbah?
- Would you be willing to test the first version?

Want to make sure I'm building what people will actually use.

Thanks,
[Your name]
