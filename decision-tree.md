# Decision Tree: What to Build Next

## After collecting 10+ pieces of feedback, use this tree:

### Question 1: Do people understand what it does?
**YES (>70% get it)** → Go to Question 2
**NO (<70% confused)** → STOP. Pivot positioning.

  - [ ] Consider video demo instead of text

### Question 2: Do people see it fitting their workflow?
**YES (>50% see the fit)** → Go to Question 3  
**NO (<50% can't map it)** → Build more integration examples
  - [ ] Add 5 more framework examples
  - [ ] Create "Try with your code" widget
  - [ ] Write integration guides for top 3 frameworks

### Question 3: Do people trust the security model?
**YES (>60% trust it)** → Go to Question 4
**NO (<60% skeptical)** → Write technical validation
  - [ ] Security whitepaper
  - [ ] Formal threat model
  - [ ] Benchmark performance
  - [ ] Get security researcher endorsement

### Question 4: Would people use it?
**YES (>20% say "I'd use this")** → BUILD PRODUCTION
  - [ ] Production API
  - [ ] Python package (PyPI)
  - [ ] JS package (npm)
  - [ ] Hosted service
  - [ ] Pricing model

**MAYBE (10-20% interested)** → Get more specific

  - [ ] Re-test with same people

**NO (<10% interested)** → MAJOR PIVOT NEEDED
  - [ ] Is this the right problem?
